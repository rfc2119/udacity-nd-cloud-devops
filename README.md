This is a meta repository containing all the coursework required to complete the nano degree. Each project focused on getting hands-on experience with the tools and concepts used to quickly deploy, manage and monitor applications in the AWS cloud

## Project 2

Deploys an HA Application Tier with CloudFormation. The project proposes an Instagram clone (called Udagram) that should be deployed on EC2 instances across two AZs. The project focuses on using CloudFormation as an IaC tool

## Project 4

A simple project to deploy a machine learning based API on Kubernetes. The machine learning part is handed out as complete, with a pre-trained model and a dataset readily taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing). The API itself is written in Python [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) and is containerized with the Docker container runtime

## Capstone Project

A free-form project that encompasses all concepts and tools used in the degree. My project offers a simple CI pipeline for [*Flexo*](https://github.com/SECCDC/flexo): a scoring that supports the South East Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (SECCDC)
